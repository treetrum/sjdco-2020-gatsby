##### Sweather was a personal project that I underwent in 2017 â€“ and have been maintaining since. My goal was to design and build a weather app that was both functional and beautiful.

When designing the interface I came up with over 30 custom icons to be associated with each state of the weather. These icons, along with the current temperature are the most prominent visual items in the user interface allowing for quick and painless user interactions. Additionally, the coloured backgrounds in the app reflect the current time of day and are constantly changing to give a fresh interaction each time you open the app.

The app is built using native Swift code and utilises the [Willy Weather API](https://www.willyweather.com.au/info/api.html) for access to weather data across Australia.
