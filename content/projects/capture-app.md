##### React Native iPhone/iPad app for Health Care Professionals

Built during my time as UI Developer at Adrenalin Media, Sanofi Capture is an app to allow Health Care Professionals to manage the subscription preferences for clients quickly and easily. The app was built using React Native and utilises Redux for state management. It includes advanced functionality including offline usage with a local drafts system, creation of customers and tight integration with a backend API.
