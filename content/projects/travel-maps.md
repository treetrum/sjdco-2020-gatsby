##### The addition of new functionality to an existing React powered travel information map for Sanofi.

Developed during my time as UI Developer at Adrenalin Media â€“ improvements were made to an existing React powered travel information map to show travellers the prevalence of various diseases throughout the world. This is powered through an API with information provided by SmartTraveller.
