Custom Drupal theme using Twig templating and React components

This site was built during my time as a Senior UI Developer at Adrenalin Media. I worked closely with a backend Drupal developer to create this outcome. All templating was done using Twig with various components such as forms/filters built using React. The site was built with a component first approach allowing the client to create highly customisable pages with ease. AA accessibility standards were strived for to allow for a high level of accessibility.

Technologies used: JavaScript/ES6, React, Twig, Sass
