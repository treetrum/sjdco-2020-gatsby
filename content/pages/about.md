Hey ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Sam Davis, a web developer with over 6 years experience.

I have over 6 years of experience working as a web developer across a wide variety of clients, products and services. I currently specialise in front end development with a focus on making beautiful product come to life. I have extensive experience with various languages, specifically HTML/CSS (Sass/Less), JavaScript/ES6/Flow/Typescript, React, React Native as well as the common front-end tools such as Webpack, Babel, Gulp, NPM, etc. I have backend development experience in NodeJS and PHP/Wordpress. I am very comfortable with a command line and am able to spin up headless server without issue. I love to learn and am always looking to better myself â€“ I work best when building something I care about, both in a team and independently.

I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com).

During my free time I am either teaching myself new technologies, undertaking some kind of personal project or playing video games. My current personal project is a rewrite for version 2 of my simple weather iOS app â€“ Sweather. 

If youâ€™d like to get in touch with me regarding work (or you just want to say hello!), please fill out the form on this page and Iâ€™ll get back to you as soon as I can.
